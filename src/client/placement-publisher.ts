// Coalescing a level stream is safe: many set()/remove() calls in one frame
// collapse to the latest level, so a transient (e.g. a relayout that momentarily
// measures 0×0 then restores) is overwritten before it is ever published. This
// is what a per-view edge stream cannot do — it is the producer half of the
// reconcile design (see ../layout/placement-reconcile.ts).
