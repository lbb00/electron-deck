/**
 * `Compositor` — engine-agnostic z-order planner for a window's native child
 * views. The observable host semantics below are covered by compositor tests.
 *
 * It separates INTENT (mount / unmount / reorder a view into a zone, at a
 * relative position) from APPLICATION (`commit()` computes the minimal sequence
 * of host add/remove calls that transforms the host's current child order into
 * the target order).
 *
 * The host's observable z-semantics this planner is built on:
 *   - `addChildView` of an ALREADY-mounted child raises it to the top WITHOUT a
 *     remove first and WITHOUT reloading it.
 *   - `addChildView` of a NEW child appends it to the end (= topmost).
 *   - A batch of remove/add in ONE synchronous tick re-lands at the target order
 *     with zero renderer reloads.
 *   - `addChildView` into a destroyed contentView throws synchronously.
 *
 * Ordering model. Every mounted view carries `(zone, orderKey, viewId)`. The
 * total render order is that triple, ascending: lower zone renders BELOW higher
 * zone (zones stack), `orderKey` orders within a zone, and `viewId` is a pure
 * tiebreak so the order is deterministic even if two keys collide. `orderKey` is
 * a FRACTIONAL key: reorder-before(X) sets the moved view's key to the midpoint
 * between X's key and its in-zone predecessor's key, so a reorder is O(1) and
 * perturbs no other view's key. When repeated midpoints exhaust float precision
 * in a gap, the affected zone is RENUMBERED (rebalance) to evenly-spaced integer
 * keys — invisible, because the renumber preserves the existing relative order.
 *
 * mount epoch. A genuinely-new mount gets a fresh monotonically-increasing
 * `mountSeq` and lands at the top of its zone. Re-mounting a view that is STILL
 * mounted is a pure no-op (same orderKey/mountSeq, zero host churn). But an
 * `unmount(id)` followed by `mount(id)` is a NEW instance: it gets a new
 * mountSeq and lands at the top — it never resumes the old slot.
 *
 * commit. We fold the batch of intents into the FINAL target state (last-state,
 * not a write-log replay), then diff the host's current children against that
 * target. The longest PREFIX of the target order whose views are already in
 * ascending host positions is left untouched; every other shared view is
 * `removeChildView` + `addChildView`, and
 * each brand-new view gets one explicit `addChildView`. All in one synchronous
 * pass. On failure `commit()` throws a typed {@link CommitError}: a destroyed
 * host with additions pending throws `host-destroyed` BEFORE touching native
 * (applied:false); a native call that throws mid-apply is caught and the host is
 * rolled back to its pre-apply snapshot, then `apply-failed` is thrown with
 * whether the rollback recovered the snapshot. A no-op commit, and a destroyed
 * host with only removals pending, are SILENT (teardown-friendly).
