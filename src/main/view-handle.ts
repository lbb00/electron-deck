/**
 * `ViewHandle` — the per-view orchestrator (view-handle.md「placeIn 与挂载」/「dispose（viewScope LIFO 序）」/「moveTo 跨窗迁移」). One handle
 * owns ONE native view and threads it through a window's z-planner. It composes
 * three INJECTED primitives and nothing else (no deck-app, no Electron):
 *   - a {@link NativeView} (its `ref` + a `setBounds` sink) — the native surface;
 *   - a {@link Scope} (`deps.scope`) — the view's home/native-view lifetime;
 *   - a {@link PlaceTarget} = `{ compositor, windowScope }` — a window's
 *     z-planner + lifetime, handed to {@link ViewHandle.placeIn}.
 *
 * Lifetime. `placeIn` adopts a `viewScope` that is a CHILD of the target
 * window's `windowScope`, so closing the windowScope cascades into the handle
 * (scope.ts cross-layer LIFO): the native view is detached and the placement
 * sink goes inert.
 *
 * handle 直接驱动 bounds. The handle drives `setBounds` DIRECTLY on its native view; the
 * Compositor stays a pure z-order planner (mount/unmount/commit only) and never
 * sees geometry.
 *
 * per-window teardown 顺序 (view-handle.md「dispose（viewScope LIFO 序）」). The viewScope owns the native detach
 * FIRST and the sink-disable LAST, so LIFO teardown runs the sink-disable
 * (STEP0) BEFORE the detach (STEP1): a late `place` frame can never drive a
 * native effect on a half-torn-down view.
 *
 * Cross-window move (view-handle.md「moveTo 跨窗迁移」/ compositor-and-teardown.md「moveTo 事务状态机」). {@link ViewHandle.moveTo}
 * migrates the view to another `{ compositor, windowScope }` as TWO independent
 * Compositor commits, guarded by a per-view async mutex (THE migrationLock —
 * each handle is one view). The current placement is a MUTABLE token so the
 * detach `own()` and `applyPlacement` always follow the CURRENT window after a
 * move. `rehome:true` re-parents the viewScope via {@link Scope.adopt} so
 * lifetime follows display; without it, lifetime stays under the src window.
